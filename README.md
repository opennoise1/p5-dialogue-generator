# Welcome to the Persona 5 Dialogue Generator!

Inspired by [Foone](https://twitter.com/Foone)'s [Death Generator](https://deathgenerator.com/), 
the Persona 5 Dialogue Generator allows you to create and download custom dialogue boxes 
using <b>over 2000 portraits</b> featured in <em>Persona 5</em>, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, and <em>Persona 5 Strikers</em>.

Try it for yourself: www.p5generator.com

As you might imagine, the <b>portraits contain spoilers</b>, so be careful if you haven't completed any of these games!

All images, including portraits and logos, are copyrights of [Atlus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus). They are displayed on this website under fair use, so consider that when deciding how to use your generated dialogue!
